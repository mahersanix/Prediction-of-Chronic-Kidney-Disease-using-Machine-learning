Kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist . They are located 
just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter 
about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine. The key 
function of the kidneys is to remove waste products and excess fluid from the body 
through the urine.
