Chronic Kidney Disease
Kidneys are two bean-shaped organs, each about the size of a fist . They are located 
just below the rib cage, one on each side of the spine. Every day, the kidneys filter 
about 120 to 150 quarts of blood to produce about 1 to 2 quarts of urine. The key 
function of the kidneys is to remove waste products and excess fluid from the body 
through the urine. 
The production of urine involves highly complex steps of excretion and reabsorption. This process is necessary to maintain a stable balance of body chemicals. 
The critical regulation of the body 's salt, potassium and acid content is performed 
by the kidneys and produce hormones that affect the function of other organs. For 
example, a hormone produced by the kidneys stimulates red blood cell production, 
regulate blood pressure and control calcium metabolism etc. Chronic kidney disease 
(CKD) is a major issue worldwide which is a condition characterized by a gradual 
loss of kidney function over time, 14% of the world population suffer from CKD. 
Over 2 million people worldwide currently receive treatment with dialysis or a 
kidney transplant to stay alive, yet this number may only represent 10% of people 
who need treatment to live. Chronic kidney disease causes more deaths than breast 
cancer or prostate cancer . The stages of CKD are mainly based on the measured or 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) which is based on creatinine level, 
gender, race and age. There are five stages of kidney functionality. 
Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss 
of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, 
which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an 
advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in 
your body.
In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. 
Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is 
significantly impaired.
Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the 
kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease 
can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering 
(dialysis) or a kidney transplant.

Symptoms
Signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease develop over time if kidney damage 
progresses slowly. Signs and symptoms of kidney disease may include:
• Nausea
• Vomiting
• Loss of appetite
• Fatigue and weakness
• Sleep problems
• Changes in how much you urinate
• Decreased mental sharpness
• Muscle twitches and cramps
• Swelling of feet and ankles
• Persistent itching
• Chest pain, if fluid builds up around the lining of the heart
• Shortness of breath, if fluid builds up in the lungs
• High blood pressure (hypertension) that's difficult to control
Signs and symptoms of kidney disease are often nonspecific, meaning they can also 
be caused by other illnesses. Because your kidneys are highly adaptable and able to 
compensate for lost function, signs and symptoms may not appear until irreversible 
damage has occurred.
Causes
Chronic kidney disease occurs when a disease or condition impairs kidney function, 
causing kidney damage to worsen over several months or years.
Diseases and conditions that cause chronic kidney disease include:
• Type 1 or type 2 diabetes
• High blood pressure
• Glomerulonephritis (gloe-mer-u-low-nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the 
kidney's filtering units (glomeruli)
• Interstitial nephritis (in-tur-STISH-ul nuh-FRY-tis), an inflammation of the 
kidney's tubules and surrounding structures
• Polycystic kidney disease
• Prolonged obstruction of the urinary tract, from conditions such as enlarged 
prostate, kidney stones and some cancers
• Vesicoureteral (ves-ih-koe-yoo-REE-tur-ul) reflux, a condition that causes 
urine to back up into your kidneys
• Recurrent kidney infection, also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRYtis)
Risk factors
Factors that may increase your risk of chronic kidney disease include:
• Diabetes
• High blood pressure
• Heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease
• Smoking
• Obesity
• Being African-American, Native American or Asian-American
• Family history of kidney disease
• Abnormal kidney structure
• Older age
Prevention - To reduce your risk of developing kidney disease:
• Follow instructions on over-the-counter medications. When using nonprescription pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, 
others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), follow the instructions on the 
package. Taking too many pain relievers could lead to kidney damage and 
generally should be avoided if you have kidney disease. Ask your doctor 
whether these drugs are safe for you.
• Maintain a healthy weight. If you're at a healthy weight, work to maintain it 
by being physically active most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, 
talk with your doctor about strategies for healthy weight loss. Often this 
involves increasing daily physical activity and reducing calories.
• Don't smoke. Cigarette smoking can damage your kidneys and make existing 
kidney damage worse. If you're a smoker, talk to your doctor about strategies 
for quitting smoking. Support groups, counseling and medications can all help 
you to stop.
• Manage your medical conditions with your doctor's help. If you have diseases 
or conditions that increase your risk of kidney disease, work with your doctor 
to control them. Ask your doctor about tests to look for signs of kidney 
damage.


Problem Statement
Prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease using 
Machine Learning
Introduction:
Technological development, including machine learning, has a huge impact on 
health through an effective analysis of various chronic diseases for more accurate 
diagnosis and successful treatment. Kidney disease is a major chronic disease 
associated with aging, hypertension, and diabetes, affecting people 60 and over. Its 
major cause is the malfunctioning of the kidney in disposing toxins from the blood. 
This study analyzes chronic kidney disease using machine learning techniques 
based on a chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) or chronic renal disease has become a major issue 
with a steady growth rate. A person can only survive without kidneys for an 
average time of 18 days, which makes a huge demand for a kidney transplant and 
Dialysis.
It is important to have effective methods for early prediction of CKD. Machine 
learning methods are effective in CKD prediction. This work proposes a workflow 
to predict CKD status based on clinical data, incorporating data prepossessing, a 
missing value handling method with collaborative filtering and attributes selection. 
Out of the 11 machine learning methods considered, the extra tree classifier and 
random forest classifier are shown to result in the highest accuracy and minimal 
bias to the attributes.
Predicting Chronic Kidney Disease based on health records
Given 24 health related attributes taken in 2-month period of 400 patients, using 
the information of the 158 patients with complete records to predict the outcome 
(i.e. whether one has chronic kidney disease) of the remaining 242 patients (with 
missing values in their records).
